# Data faker

This is a small tool I made which allows you to fake some basic data for a business over a period of time using some initial values, randomness (via seed) and normal distributions. There are simple seaonsal variations via trigonometric functions.</br>

To edit the initial values you can use the webapp or import your own from the json template in the './initial_conditions' folder.</br>

The requirements are stored in the requirements.txt, you can install them onto a virtual environment or on your machine using the 'requirements.txt':</br>

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To run the app open a git bash terminal and run:</br>

`streamlit run app.py`
